## 📌 Research Focus

> **Title**: AI-based Detection and Classification of Pulmonary Nodules in CT Scans  
> **Goal**: Support radiologists in early diagnosis of lung cancer through intelligent systems.

🔍 Key Areas:
- 3D medical image segmentation (CT)
- Deep learning (CNNs, U-Net, 3D ResNet)
- Explainable AI (Grad-CAM, SHAP)
- Dataset annotation and DICOM preprocessing
- Classification: Benign vs Malignant nodules
